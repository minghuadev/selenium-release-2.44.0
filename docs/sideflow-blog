Selenium IDE Flow Control - Goto and While Loops
==================================================

This extension provides goto, gotoIf and while loop functionality 
in Selenium IDE. 

There is an excellent flow-control extension at wiki.openqa.org/display/SEL/flowControl 
for the Selenium RC and TestRunner components, but it does not work 
with Selenium IDE (the Firefox plugin) directly. This makes it difficult 
to develop controlled test cases within Selenium IDE, and there are times 
when the frame-based TestRunner cannot be used (such as when the website 
under test employs a frame-buster script).

I've ported the existing control-flow extension to work in the Selenium IDE 
Firefox add-on. The image below shows a sample test case using goto, gotoIf 
and a while loop, all running successfully in Selenium IDE.

The file can be downloaded from Github and should be saved as "sideflow.js" 
to your hard drive. Then the Options settings in Selenium IDE should set 
the Selenium Core extensions to include the path of this file.
